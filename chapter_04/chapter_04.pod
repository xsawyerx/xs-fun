=head1 Chapter 04 - Better Construction

=head2 What's in a constructor?

Most constructors don't just create objects. Blessing a reference is cool,
but usually we need more than that. If we want to improve our constructor,
we would need to make it update the attributes we keep in the hash.

Of course, one more important feature is being able to provide attribute
subroutines. They will allow us to fetch the attribute from the hash and
to set a new value - what's called I<full affordance accessors>.

This chapter will start with creating a default value for an attribute
(or, rather, a key in our C<$self> hash), and will then focus on improving
the accessor by letting it set the attribute value by user arguments.

Since this covers quite a lot of ground, we will leave the accessors to
a future chapter.

Let's dig in!

=head2 First, the tests

To make sure we don't screw up, we will write some tests. They will cover
checking our constructor.

Reading the documentation for B<Chromaprint>, we see that there's an attribute
defining the algorithm to be used. It has a default, B<test2> (or the actual
constant name, B<CHROMAPRINT_ALGORITHM_TEST2>). Let's test that we're setting
it properly.

=head3 new.t

Beginning with F<t/new.t>, we can write the following simple test:

    #!perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::More tests => 2;
    use Audio::Chromaprint;

    my $cp = Audio::Chromaprint->new();

    isa_ok( $cp, 'Audio::Chromaprint' );
    is(
        $cp->{'algorithm'},
        'test2',
        'Constructor set correct default algorithm',
    );

=head3 Running

When running the test, we can ask the testing harness to only run the new
test file we wrote and nothing else.

Assuming we have the default template with nothing in it, running the test
will work as such:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make && make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 TEST_FILES="t/new.t"

Once we ran the F<Makefile.PL>, we have a given F<Makefile> file, and it
allows us to repeat the C<make && make test> line as many times as we want.

Here is the output:

    1..2
    ok 1 - The object isa Audio::Chromaprint
    not ok 2 - Constructor set correct default algorithm

    #   Failed test 'Constructor set correct default algorithm'
    #   at t/new.t line 13.
    #          got: undef
    #     expected: 'test2'
    # Looks like you failed 1 test of 2.
    Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
    Failed 1/2 subtests

As you can see, we failed the second test because we did not provide a
value. Let's fix it.

=head2 Adding a default value

To add a default value, we would need to add data to the hash. This means
creating a new value (B<test2>) and setting it in a key in the hash
we created.

We can use C<hv_store> (which can be found it L<perlapi>) in order to store
a new value in the hash we created in the previous chapter. Let's add it:

    SV *
    new( const char *class, ... )
        CODE:
            HV *hash = newHV();

            /* using sv_store we need to provide the following:
               * hash in which to store
               * the key
               * key length
               * SV with the value
               * pre-calculated hash or 0
            */

            hv_store(
                hash,                                /* created before */
                "algorithm",                         /* key */
                strlen("algorithm"),                 /* length */
                newSVpv( "test2", strlen("test2") ), /* new SV with PV */
                0                                    /* let Perl calculate */
            );

            SV* const self = newRV_noinc( (SV *)hash );
    
            RETVAL = sv_bless( self, gv_stashpv( class, 0 ) );
        OUTPUT: RETVAL

=head2 Ru-run tests

    $ make && make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 TEST_FILES="t/new.t"

    1..2
    ok 1 - The object isa Audio::Chromaprint
    ok 2 - Constructor set correct default algorithm
    ok
    All tests successful.

It works!

=head2 Smarter constructor

Now that we have a default, we would like the user to be able to set it
to anything it wants.

=head3 Improving our test

Let's write a test to reflect what we want to happen. We'll start with
what we have and add another chunk that changes the value using the
constructor. We put each chunk its own scope so we don't override the
variables.

    #!perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::More tests => 4;
    use Audio::Chromaprint;

    {
        my $cp = Audio::Chromaprint->new();

        isa_ok( $cp, 'Audio::Chromaprint' );
        is(
            $cp->{'algorithm'},
            'test2',
            'Constructor set correct default algorithm',
        );
    }

    {
        my $cp = Audio::Chromaprint->new(
            algorithm => 'test3'
        );

        isa_ok( $cp, 'Audio::Chromaprint' );
        is(
            $cp->{'algorithm'},
            'test3',
            'Constructor set correct algorithm from argument',
        );
    }

=head3 Running it

    $ make && make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 TEST_FILES="t/new.t"

    1..4
    ok 1 - The object isa Audio::Chromaprint
    ok 2 - Constructor set correct default algorithm
    ok 3 - The object isa Audio::Chromaprint
    not ok 4 - Constructor set correct algorithm from argument

    #   Failed test 'Constructor set correct algorithm from argument'
    #   at t/new.t line 25.
    #          got: 'test2'
    #     expected: 'test3'
    # Looks like you failed 1 test of 4.
    Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
    Failed 1/4 subtests

We are now failing because we're not setting the attribute value using the
argument provided by our test. We need to fix it.

=head3 Checking input better

If we want to handle key/value pairs as input to the constructor, we need
to have a better check of the input. What if we expect a pair and the user
sends in a hash reference? What if it's an array reference? Let's be more
explicit in what we allow before we try to analyze it.

We will add the following piece of code after the B<CODE> segment in our
XSUB:

    CODE:
        /* check the number of input arguments */
        /* "items" represents the argument count */
        if ( ( items - 1 ) % 2 )
            croak("Expecting key/value pairs as input to constructor\n");

        // ... rest of code ...

Should we test it? Yes, we should!

=head3 Testing the limits

We can simply add this following block to the F<t/new.t> test file:

    use Test::Fatal;

    {
        like(
            exception { Audio::Chromaprint->new('SingleInput') },
            qr{^Expecting key/value pairs as input to constructor},
            'Incorrect input for single item (instead of pairs)',
        );

        like(
            exception { Audio::Chromaprint->new( 1, 2, 3 ) },
            qr{^Expecting key/value pairs as input to constructor},
            'Incorrect input for odd items (instead of pairs(',
        );

        is(
            exception { Audio::Chromaprint->new() },
            undef,
            'Successful at calling a constructor without arguments',
        );

        is(
            exception { Audio::Chromaprint->new( key => 'value' ) },
            undef,
            'Successful at calling a constructor with even items',
        );
    }

Trying it out...

    1..8
    ok 1 - Incorrect input for single item (instead of pairs)
    ok 2 - Incorrect input for odd items (instead of pairs(
    ok 3 - Successful at calling a constructor without arguments
    ok 4 - Successful at calling a constructor with even items
    ok 5 - The object isa Audio::Chromaprint
    ok 6 - Constructor set correct default algorithm
    ok 7 - The object isa Audio::Chromaprint
    not ok 8 - Constructor set correct algorithm from argument

    #   Failed test 'Constructor set correct algorithm from argument'
    #   at t/new.t line 51.
    #          got: 'test2'
    #     expected: 'test3'
    # Looks like you failed 1 test of 8.
    Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
    Failed 1/8 subtests

Alright. It all passes, except for actually setting the value according to
the input from the user.

=head3 Looping over the Perl stack

The Perl interpreter puts all the variables from the Perl side on a stack.
The stack has pointers to SVs that represent what the user sent to the XSUB.
Pretty simple. It's actually that simple to play with it too.

Right after our code that goes over the items, we can loop over the stack
(available using the C<ST> macro) and use the information there to add
variables to the hash we created.

Let's take a look at a simple example that will use C<hv_store_ent> (which
can also find in L<perlapi>). We used the C<hv_store> function in the default
because we had strings for the key and value. However, in this case, because
we get SVs from the stack, we can use C<hv_store_ent>, which allows us to
store using SVs for key and value.

This, however, will cause a problem, which we will see.

    CODE:
        if ( ( items - 1 ) % 2 )
            croak("Expecting key/value pairs as input to constructor\n");

        HV *hash = newHV();

        hv_store(
            hash,                                /* created before */
            "algorithm",                         /* key */
            strlen("algorithm"),                 /* length */
            newSVpv( "test2", strlen("test2") ), /* new SV with PV */
            0                                    /* let Perl calculate */
        );

        int i;
        for ( i = 1; i < items; i += 2 ) {
            /* get two items from the stack  */
            /* it starts from 1 in this case */
            SV *key   = ST(i);
            SV *value = ST( i + 1 ); 

            /* store the value by key in the hash */
            hv_store_ent( hash, key, value, 0 );
        }

        /* ... rest of code ... */

=head3 Trying it out

If we actually run this code, we will get this warning in our output:

    Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x26f9ac0, Perl interpreter:
    0x24c5010.

The reason is simple, but the explanation is a bit tricky to follow.[1]

When we pick the SV from the stack, it has no actual references to it. Okay,
I'm lying. It has one, which is the one from the op code, but that will just
confuse you - better to think of it as I<no one is holding on to this>.

This is why Perl actually releases it before it even exits the scope in which
it's running in the test. When it exits the scope, it tries to release it yet
again, but it fails, because it has already been released, hence the warning.

If we read the documentation of C<hv_store_ent> in C<perlapi>, it has the
following sentence: I<Note that the caller is responsible for suitably
incrementing the reference count of "val" before the call>.

So we can simply increment the reference count for the SV.

    /* get two items from the stack  */
    /* it starts from 1 in this case */
    SV *key   = ST(i);
    SV *value = ST( i + 1 );

    /* increment */
    SvREFCNT_inc(value);

Running the tests:

    t/new.t ..
    1..8
    ok 1 - Incorrect input for single item (instead of pairs)
    ok 2 - Incorrect input for odd items (instead of pairs(
    ok 3 - Successful at calling a constructor without arguments
    ok 4 - Successful at calling a constructor with even items
    ok 5 - The object isa Audio::Chromaprint
    ok 6 - Constructor set correct default algorithm
    ok 7 - The object isa Audio::Chromaprint
    ok 8 - Constructor set correct algorithm from argument
    ok
    All tests successful.

I<[1] If you find this confusing, please help me correct it!>


=head2 More problems

There is a side-effect we get here that, unless we understand how things
work, will bite us at some point without us even realizing it.

If you add the following to the test code:

    $cp->{'algorithm'} = 'test1';

You will get the following output:

    ...
    ok 8 - Constructor set correct algorithm from argument
    Modification of a read-only value attempted at t/new.t line 57.
    # Looks like your test exited with 2 just after 8.
    Dubious, test returned 2 (wstat 512, 0x200)

Wait, what?

=head3 What's going on?

When you store a value from XS using either C<hv_store> or
C<hv_store_ent>, Perl stores the passed SV without making a copy (and
discarding the previous value for that key if present). On the other
hand the code executed when assigning to the key from Perl fetches the
current value SV for that key (creating it if it is a new key) and
changes its PV with a PV of the new string you wanted to assign.

So if the SV stored by C<hv_store>/C<hv_store_ent> is read-only, this
won't work. So how do we fix it? Well, we can do various different
things:

=over 4

=item * Send a variable instead of string

Current we use the C<new> method as such:

    my $cp = Algorithm::Chromaprint->new( algorithm => 'test3' );

B<test3> here is a static string. It's not a variable. This is why, if we
dump the variable using C<sv_dump> in the XS, as such:

    SV *value = ST( i + 1 );

    /* dump value */
    sv_dump(value);

we will get the following output:

    SV = PV(0x267ba70) at 0x26b3b00
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (PADTMP,POK,READONLY,pPOK)
      PV = 0x26bfaa0 "test3"\0
      CUR = 5
      LEN = 16

(This is the same output you will get with L<Devel::Peek>.)

You can see the B<FLAGS> entry has B<PADTMP> and B<READONLY>. This is
because it's a temporary lexical variable and read-only.

We can just send a variable instead:

    my $algo = 'test3';
    my $cp   = Audio::Chromaprint->new( algorithm => $algo );

But... do we really want to do it this way? No. We don't. Besides, we want to
make sure the SV has the right reference count. We're responsible for it.

=item * Remove the READONLY flag

The next chapter will side-track to cover the B<READONLY> flag and will help
understand this better. Suffice to say that, while it's possible to simply
disable the B<READONLY> restriction and then change the value anyway, this
will cause a massive action-at-a-distance behavior in the future, and we
(and everyone we care about) will hate us forever for this.

We do B<NOT> want to do this.

=item * Do what Perl does on assignment

Use C<hv_fetch>/C<hv_fetch_ent> with the C<lvalue> flag set, getting
the SV holding the current value for the key, and use one of the
C<SvSet*> macros to copy the contents of the SV we got from the stack
into the SV returned by C<hv_fetch>/C<hv_fetch_ent>. This is more
efficient (but more convoluted) than the alternative below.

=item * Create a new SV with the value

The best way to handle it is to create a new SV using the SV we got from
the stack. While the SV from the stack will get freed automatically by Perl,
we will provide our own independent SV, which will not be read-only, and
which could easily be added to the hash.

=item * Do the same but manually

What Perl does on assignment is fetch the HV using C<hv_fetch>/C<hv_fetch_ent>
with the C<lvalue> flag set, get the SV holding the current value for the key,
and use one of the C<SvSet*> macros to copy the contents of the SV we got from
the stack into the SV returned by C<hv_fetch>/C<hv_fetch_ent>.

While this is more efficient than the alternative above, it is also
convoluted, so we will keep it for a future chapter.

=back

=head3 Creating a new SV

To create a new SV, we use C<newSVsv>, which creates a new SV from an
existing SV. This means that whether the user provided a value which is a
string (PV), an integer (IV), or a double (NV), we will have it in the new
SV.

    SV *key   = ST(i);
    SV *value = newSVsv( ST( i + 1 ) );

The call to C<SvREFCNT_inc> is no longer necessary.
