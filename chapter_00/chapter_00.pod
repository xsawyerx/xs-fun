=head1 Chapter 00 - Preparing the Skeleton

=head2 A Good Start

Let's start by creating the basic layout for our module.

Create a directory for the project called F<XSFun>. Enter the directory
and begin creating the following files.

=head3 XSFun.pm

Create a directory called F<lib> and inside it create a file called
F<XSFun.pm>, content as follows:

    package XSFun;

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Exporter;
    use XSLoader;

    use base 'Exporter';

    our $VERSION     = '0.001';
    our @EXPORT_TAGS = ( 'all' => [] );
    our @EXPORT_OK   = ( @{ $EXPORT_TAGS{'all'} } );

    XSLoader::load('XSFun', $VERSION);

    1;

L<XSLoader> loads C libraries dynamically so they can be used in Perl.

As soon as you C<use XSFun>, it will load our XS code using L<XSLoader> and
make it available and known to Perl.

=head3 Makefile.PL

In the top-level we create the F<Makefile.PL> which will generate a proper
F<Makefile>, content as follows:

    use 5.008005;
    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
    WriteMakefile(
        NAME           => 'XSFun',
        VERSION_FROM   => 'lib/XSFun.pm',
        PREREQ_PM      => { 'Test::More' => 0 },
        ABSTRACT_FROM  => 'lib/XSFun.pm',
        AUTHOR         => 'You',
        LIBS           => [''],
        DEFINE         => '',
        INC            => '-I.',
        OBJECT         => '$(O_FILES)',
    );

=head3 ppport.h

The F<ppport.h> file (Perl/Pollution/Portability) contains a series of
macros and, if explicitly requested, functions that allow XS modules to
be built using older versions of Perl.

You can generate it using the following command:

    perl -MDevel::PPPort -E'Devel::PPPort::WriteFile'

=head3 XSFun.xs

The XS file contains both XS code and possibly valid C code. At first we
will insert C code into it, but with time we will use it to connect to
existing libraries.

If you want to optimize something, you can simply implement it directly in
the XS file. If you want to connect to another library, you will use the
XS code in order to glue together an existing library and Perl.

Create the file F<XSFun.xs> with the following content:

    #include "EXTERN.h"
    #include "perl.h"
    #include "XSUB.h"
    #include "ppport.h"

    /* C functions */

    MODULE = XSFun      PACKAGE = XSFun

    # XS code

The first three lines are XS lines. You next line uses the portability
layer of F<ppport.h>. After that we can insert any C code we want. Then,
we give enough XS information to connect this XS file to our Perl code.
Then we can provide more advanced XS functionality.

From this point on we will use this setup as our skeleton. You can save it
separately and copy it over in every new chapter.
